This is a repository of code for grabbing and manipulating data from the Venues API of foursquare. For reference, the Venues Platform URL is as follows: https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/venues

This is a sample project for my own education and learning. The intent is to use this project to develop a collection of R scripts for analyzing spatial data.

I will be creating a different repository for the R scripts which will be of sufficiently good quality to follow or fork by other users if required.
